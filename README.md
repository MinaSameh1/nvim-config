# This is my Neovim Config

Everything in Lua :D

I use a lot of plugins because why not,
most of the time the plugs don't slow me down and they are lazy loaded anyways.

# Refrences
1. [Lazy Loading](https://github.com/numToStr/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/.config/nvim/lua/numToStr/plugins.lua).
1. [numToStr Dotfiles used as inspiration](https://github.com/numToStr/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/.config/nvim/lua/numToStr/plugins.lua).
1. LuaStatus line is from the offical repo the example and modified a tiny bit.
