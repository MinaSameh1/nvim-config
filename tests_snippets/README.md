This is something for me to test my snippets, It's meant to be quick and dirty

no reason to care for performance or anything during these tests

I got tired of having to write a snippet, reopen the editor and try it out every time.

Instead of creating a full automated tests it is sorta of an automated manual test, it
waits for user input to continue to see if sucess or fail, obviously in a real production environment or system
you would not make it like this, but it is just because I am lazy to open the terminal and type 3 letters then press ctrl+space, why
spend 5 mins doing something when you can spend an hour to do it! In the future I might make it a real tests using python's test lib and add @test annotations all that good stuff, but for now
it is just a meh automated manual test.
